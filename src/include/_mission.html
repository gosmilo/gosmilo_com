                OUR VISION
            </div>

            <div class="mv-content">
                Our vision is to facilitate a culture of transparency by making collective data irreversible and publicly available, whilst protecting personal data.<br/>
                <br/>
                This will significantly limit the chance of corruption whilst simultaneously acknowledging the need to protect the individual’s data. A decline of middle men will occur due to the irreversible nature of Smilo’s user-friendly hybrid smart contracts.<br/>
                <br/>
                The combination of public and private transactions on one blockchain platform, based on the Smilo Network Protocol in combination with the Smilo BFT+ consensus mechanism, defines Smilo as a hybrid blockchain platform with a conscience.<br/>

                OUR MISSION
            </div>

            <div class="mv-content">
                Our mission is to create an environment in which the consumer's need for privacy and security will be aligned with the processes of governments, NGOs, financial institutions and corporations. This will be accomplished by warranting full accountability and transparency from corporations, whilst safeguarding the consumer’s needs.<br/>
                <br/>
                This environment will be hosted on Smilo’s decentralised, secure, fast, and sustainable hybrid blockchain platform. Not to mention, Smilo will make their source code publicly available, meaning that future blockchains, organisations and their applications can apply it to their specific needs.<br/>
